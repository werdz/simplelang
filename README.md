Simplelang
==========

A simple raw-stuff-from-the-internet processing library.

Purpose
-------
I'm working on some external code that will involve harvesting large amounts of data from the internet. The problem is, the internet is full of stuff written by people who hate other programmers and are bent on making their lives a nightmare. Not with protection or anything, just by not giving a donkey's about things like machine readability, etc. This library is intended to help to process through some of that noise.

As well as that, this library should be able to pull some useful information from a file. More on this once I implement it.

Install
-------
No setup.py just yet, but there will be someday. For now, just throw the simplelang/ directory anywhere in your PYTHONPATH.
